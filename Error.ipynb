    "-- your job was to make this thing work (build code, test and repeat until perfect.) So easily we attribute failure to human intervention and lack of perfection. I do not agree. I believe people make mistakes but mistakes are greatly decreased and many times eliminated when working effectively. now, the biggest of the biggest have messed up, how dare you reach for perfection and think otherwise. You are a human, even expert human can't get it right all the time. sure. bigger beliefs over here.\n",

I believe people make mistakes but mistakes are greatly decreased and many times eliminated when working effectively. now, the biggest of the biggest have messed up, how dare you reach for perfection and think otherwise. You are a human, even expert human can't get it right all the time. sure. bigger beliefs over here.\n",
